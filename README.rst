pPXF: Full Spectrum Fitting with Photometry for Stars and Galaxies

    
Usage examples in Jupyter Notebook for the procedure pPXF originally described in Cappellari & Emsellem (2004), substantially upgraded in Cappellari (2017) and with the inclusion of photometry and linear constraints in Cappellari (2022).

pPXF extracts the galaxy stellar and gas kinematics, stellar population and gas emission by fitting a set of templates to an observed spectrum, or to a combination of a spectrum and photometry (SED), via full-spectrum fitting.

One can run the Jupyter notebooks without installing anything by clicking on the binder button above. Just note that the code will run much faster on your local computer.
